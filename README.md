# Setup your db for Login Credentials
* Add your table for users
   * table name: `users`
   * fields
    ```user_id serial primary key not null
    user_name varchar(32) unique
    user_password varchar(64) not null
    user_modified_on timestamp without time zone default now()
    user_delete_ind boolean default false

# Create the login page

* See `IE271caseapp/apps/login.py` for the layout
  * Use `type='password'` for `dbc.Input` to hide texts in passwords
* It looks like movieprofile in this case but you can always design it differently
* Check the callback for the login process
  * Querying the credentials into the database
  * Using a hash on the password before checking credentials
  * If trigger is...
    * login button -- query if the credentials are in the db
    * logout (via `sessionlogout` variable) -- reset the session variables to values that correspond to logging out

# Create the signup page

1. Copy `login.py` and paste in the same page. You should have `login copy.py`.
2. Rename the copy into `signup.py`.
3. Simply rename the fields to make it look like a signup page. We are assuming that each user only need a username and password since this is only a demo. In real-life, this might not be the case. 
4. Create the callbacks for the signup page. See `IE271caseapp/apps/signup.py` for the relevant source code.
   * Find how passwords are **_hashed_** prior to saving to the db

*Optional*: You may also want the following controls to the signup page:

- Checking for strong passwords
- Checking for duplicate usernames
- Feedbacks for duplicate usernames



# Setup the index.py

1. Go to index.py.
2. Add `dcc.Store` elements to save login credentials (i.e. details necessary during the session)
   * `sessionlogout` -- bool, indicator on whether the session is logged-in or not
   * `currentuserid` -- int, stores the user_id of the current user; if logged-out, has a value -1
   * `currentrole` -- int, stores the role_id (if any) of the current user; if logged_out, has a value of -1
3. Put the `Navbar` inside a `Div` so we can hide it when the user is not logged in
4. Edit the callback to add `login.py` and `signup.py`
   1. Note how login-states are checked prior to routing to the correct pages
      * `login` and `signup` pages are only accessible if the user is not signed in (i.e. session userid = -1)
   2. The `sessionlogout` variable, bool, is decided based on various indicators for login-status.
   3. The navbar is hidden (or shown) based on the value of `sessionlogout`.


# Add logout link to the navbar

1. Add a link so you can logout. 
2. Incorporate the logout URL to `index.py` so it leads to the proper landing page.
